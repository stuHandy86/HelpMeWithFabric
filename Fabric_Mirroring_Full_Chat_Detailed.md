# Full Chat Transcript: Microsoft Fabric Mirroring, CDC, SQL Server Load, and CU Consumption

---

## üßµ User Prompt
**Explain to me in detail how Microsoft Fabric mirroring reduces load on the source sql server. Currently refreshes for datasets are run on multiple schedules per semantic model. Some of these are refreshing up to 48 hours per day. I need to explain to the the IT infrastructure team the benefits this will have.**

### ‚úÖ Assistant Response
Microsoft Fabric's **mirroring** capability is designed to **significantly reduce load on source SQL Servers**‚Äîa critical benefit when you're running frequent dataset refreshes across many semantic models.

---

### üî∑ What is Microsoft Fabric Mirroring?
Fabric Mirroring creates a **near real-time, fully managed replica** of your source database in OneLake. Once mirrored, this data can be **queried and consumed directly within Microsoft Fabric**, eliminating or greatly reducing the need to repeatedly hit the source system for refreshes.

---

### ‚úÖ Key Benefits of Mirroring for Reducing Load on Source SQL Server

#### üö´ 1. No Repeated Full Table Scans
- Dataset refreshes hit SQL Server directly.
- Queries may scan large tables and join logic.
- Multiple refreshes per day create I/O and CPU pressure.
- With mirroring, refreshes target OneLake instead.

#### ‚ôªÔ∏è 2. Incremental Sync vs Full Refresh
- Traditional refreshes still require scanning and transformations.
- Mirroring uses change tracking or CDC for efficient delta updates.

#### ‚öôÔ∏è 3. Offloads Analytical Workloads to Fabric
- SQL Server is freed from analytical workloads.
- Analytical compute happens in Fabric‚Äôs engine.

#### üìà 4. Scalability & Centralized Refresh
- Shared mirrored data allows multiple semantic models to reuse a single ingestion pipeline.
- Fewer refreshes = drastically reduced source system load.

#### üîê 5. Improved Stability, Security, and Auditing
- Reduces direct query access to SQL Server.
- Enhanced governance and observability in Fabric.

---

## üßÆ Real-World Example: Refresh Load Reduction
- 10 semantic models √ó 6 refreshes/day = 60 refreshes
- 45 hours/day total SQL Server query time
- With mirroring: One sync, reused across models = major load reduction

## üßµ User Prompt
**How does it affect CU consumption on a Microsoft fabric capacity**

### ‚úÖ Assistant Response
Covers how Fabric Capacity Units (CUs) are affected:

#### CU Summary:
- CUs are consumed by compute activities in Fabric.
- Mirroring does consume CUs, but:
  - **Initial sync** is heavier
  - **Delta updates** are very efficient
- Each Power BI dataset refresh no longer re-ingests from the source‚Äîjust queries mirrored data.

#### Without Mirroring:
- Every refresh re-ingests and reprocesses data.
- High CU consumption and SQL Server strain.

#### With Mirroring:
- One-time ingestion, reused by all models.
- Predictable and lower CU use.

| Scenario           | CU Impact                            |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Without Mirroring  | High CU + High SQL Server load        |
| With Mirroring     | Lower CU + No SQL Server strain       |

**How does enabling cdc affect the load on the sql server**

### ‚úÖ Assistant Response
CDC load breakdown:

#### What CDC Does:
- Asynchronously reads SQL Server‚Äôs transaction log.
- Writes changes to system tables (`cdc.<capture_instance>`).
- Doesn't block or alter OLTP performance.

#### Load Breakdown:

| Resource       | Impact                                                 |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| CPU            | Low to moderate (log parsing only)                     |
| Disk I/O       | Moderate (writes changes to `cdc` tables)              |
| Transaction Log| Can grow if CDC data isn't cleaned or consumed         |
| Storage        | Depends on DML volume and retention                    |
| Maintenance    | Needs cleanup jobs and monitoring                      |

#### Best Practices:
- Limit CDC to necessary tables.
- Monitor log and storage usage.
- Run cleanup jobs regularly.
