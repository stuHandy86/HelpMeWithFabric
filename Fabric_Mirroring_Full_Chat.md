# Full Chat Transcript: Microsoft Fabric Mirroring, CDC, and SQL Server Load Reduction

---

## üßµ User Prompt
**Explain to me in detail how Microsoft Fabric mirroring reduces load on the source sql server. Currently refreshes for datasets are run on multiple schedules per semantic model. Some of these are refreshing up to 48 hours per day. I need to explain to the the IT infrastructure team the benefits this will have.**

### ‚úÖ Assistant Response
Detailed explanation of how Microsoft Fabric Mirroring reduces SQL Server load, including:
- Mirroring architecture overview
- Elimination of redundant refreshes
- Offloading compute from SQL Server to Fabric
- Shared ingestion via OneLake
- Real-world example: 48 hours/day of refresh load reduced to one shared mirror
- Summary table for infrastructure team

## üßµ User Prompt
**Can you provide extra detail**

### ‚úÖ Assistant Response
Expanded explanation covering:
- Technical breakdown of mirroring
- How fan-out model reduces ingestion redundancy
- Incremental sync and CDC mechanisms
- Deep dive into Fabric refresh efficiency
- CU optimization and reduced I/O
- Governance, security, and risk reduction
- Detailed impact table (CPU, network, refresh reliability, etc.)

---

## üßµ User Prompt
**How does it affect CU consumption on a Microsoft fabric capacity**

### ‚úÖ Assistant Response
Explanation of Fabric CU (Capacity Unit) model:
- Mirroring initial sync vs delta sync CU cost
- Comparison: CU usage with vs without mirroring
- Fabric refresh impact on CU
- Monitoring CU via capacity metrics
- Summary table comparing CU usage scenarios
- Fabric documentation links mentioned (verbally)

## üßµ User Prompt
**How does enabling cdc affect the load on the sql server**

### ‚úÖ Assistant Response
Deep technical explanation of CDC effects:
- CDC reads the transaction log asynchronously
- CDC table growth and log bloat
- Disk and I/O implications
- Retention and cleanup job importance
- Performance tuning: storage, indexing, job scheduling
- Risk vs reward table (later formalized)

---

## üßµ User Prompt
**Can you list the risks and benefits**

### ‚úÖ Assistant Response
Tabular format listing:
- ‚úÖ CDC Benefits (e.g., low OLTP impact, efficient incremental tracking)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è CDC Risks (e.g., log growth, backup size, disk use)
- Summary and mitigation strategies for each risk
